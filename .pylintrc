# Disable W (Warnings), and I (Information)
# Also disable specific checks that don't fit this codebase:
#   - invalid-name: Module names start with numbers (01a_time_of_flight), variables use physics conventions (I, Q)
#   - import-error, no-name-in-module: quam_config is project-specific, pylint can't resolve it
#   - too-many-locals: Quantum calibration code often needs many variables
