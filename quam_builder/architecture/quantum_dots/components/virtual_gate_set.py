class VirtualGateSet(GateSet):
    """
    A set of virtual gates that can be used to create a virtual gate layer.

    Inheriting from GateSet, VirtualGateSet allows control of a set of virtual
    gates that can be used to create a virtual gate layer.

    A VirtualGateSet manages a collection of channels (instances of `SingleChannel`,
    including subclasses like `VoltageGate`) and provides all the functionalities
    of a GateSet, plus functionality to:
    - Add any number of virtualization layers onto any subset of physical or virtual gates,
      using square, invertible, user-defined matrices
    - Define named voltage tuning points (macros), which can consist of any combination of
      physical and virtual gates, that can be reused across sequences
    - Resolve voltages for all gates, even if the input voltages contain both physical
      and virtual gates; with default fallbacks

    The VirtualGateSet retains all the capabilities of the GateSet (i.e. acting as
    a logical grouping of related channels), while also allowing linear combinations
    of physical and virtual gates for universal control.

    Attributes:
        layers: A list of `VirtualizationLayer` objects, applied sequentially.
        channels: Inherited from `GateSet`. Physical channels are `SingleChannel`
            instances (and may be `VoltageGate` objects) that the virtual gates
            ultimately resolve to.

    Example:
        >>> from quam.components.channels import SingleChannel
        >>> # Create channels for a quantum dot
        >>> plunger_ch = SingleChannel("plunger", ...)
        >>> barrier_ch = SingleChannel("barrier", ...)
        >>>
        >>> # Create virtual gate set
        >>> dot_gates = VirtualGateSet(
        ...     id="dot1",
        ...     channels={"plunger": plunger_ch, "barrier": barrier_ch}
        ... )
        >>>
        >>> # Create any number of virtualization layers
        >>> dot_gates.add_layer()
        ...     source_gates = ["virtual1", "virtual2"],
        ...     target_gates=["plunger", "barrier"],
        ...     matrix = [[1, 0.3],[0.4, 1]]
        ... )
        >>>
        >>> # Add voltage tuning points
        >>> dot_gates.add_point("load", {"virtual1": 0.5, "barrier": -0.2}, 1000)
        >>> dot_gates.add_point("measure", {"plunger": 0.3, "virtual2": 0.1}, 500)
