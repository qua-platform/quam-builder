class GateSet(QuantumComponent):
    """
    Represents a set of gate channels used for voltage sequencing in quantum dot
    experiments.

    A GateSet manages a collection of channels (instances of `SingleChannel`,
    including subclasses like `VoltageGate`) and provides
    functionality to:
    - Define named voltage tuning points (macros) that can be reused across
      sequences
    - Resolve voltages for all channels with default fallbacks
    - Create voltage sequences with proper channel configuration

    The GateSet acts as a logical grouping of related channels (e.g., gates
    controlling a specific quantum dot) and enables high-level voltage control
    operations. This class also serves as the base for VirtualGateSet, which
    enables linear combinations of physical gates.

    Attributes:
        channels: Dictionary mapping channel names to `SingleChannel` instances.
            This may include `VoltageGate` objects, which are specialized
            `SingleChannel`s that model voltage gates with optional attenuation
            and DC offset handling.

    Example:
        >>> from quam.components.channels import SingleChannel
        >>> # Create channels for a quantum dot
        >>> plunger_ch = SingleChannel("plunger", ...)
        >>> barrier_ch = SingleChannel("barrier", ...)
        >>>
        >>> # Create gate set
        >>> dot_gates = GateSet(
        ...     id="dot1",
        ...     channels={"plunger": plunger_ch, "barrier": barrier_ch}
        ... )
        >>>
        >>> # Add voltage tuning points
        >>> dot_gates.add_point("load", {"plunger": 0.5, "barrier": -0.2}, 1000)
        >>> dot_gates.add_point("measure", {"plunger": 0.3, "barrier": 0.1}, 500)
        >>>
        >>> # Create and use voltage sequence
        >>> with qua.program() as prog:
        ...     seq = dot_gates.new_sequence()
        ...     seq.step_to_point("load")  # Uses the predefined voltage point

        Resolves voltages for all channels in the GateSet.

        Adds any channels in the GateSet that are not in the provided voltages dict

        entries correspond to valid channels in this GateSet.

        This method is particularly useful when you want to specify voltages for only
