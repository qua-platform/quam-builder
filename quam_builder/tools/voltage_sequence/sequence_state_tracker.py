class SequenceStateTracker:
    """
    Tracks and manages the dynamic state of a single gate element within a sequence.

    This class is responsible for maintaining the last applied voltage level
    (`current_level`) and the accumulated time-integrated voltage
    (`integrated_voltage`) for the specified element. The integrated voltage
    is crucial for calculating DC compensation pulses.

    The class handles both standard Python numerical types (float, int) for
    voltages and durations, as well as QUA variables/expressions
    (`QuaVariable`, `QuaExpression`). When QUA types are involved in calculations
    that update the integrated voltage, the internal tracking for the element's
    integrated voltage is automatically promoted to a QUA variable if it isn't
    one already. This ensures that all calculations involving QUA types are
    performed within the QUA execution environment.

    Attributes:
        element_name (str): The name of the element tracked by this instance.
        current_level (VoltageLevelType): The current voltage level of the element.
            Can be read and set.
        integrated_voltage (Union[int, QuaVariable]): The accumulated integrated
            voltage. Read-only from an external perspective (updated via methods).

    Key functionalities include:
    - Initializing the state for a single element (starting at 0V and
      0 integrated voltage).
    - Updating the accumulated integrated voltage based on a pulse's level,
      duration, and optional ramp duration.
    - Resetting the integrated voltage (typically done after
      ramping to zero or applying full compensation).

    The integrated voltage is calculated as `sum(level * duration)` for steps,
    and includes the contribution from ramps, scaled by
    `INTEGRATED_VOLTAGE_SCALING_FACTOR` for fixed-point precision when QUA
    variables are used.
